    "description": "Open-methods are free-standing functions that work like virtual functions: they select the b​est overrider from a set, depending on the dynamic type of their arguments. This makes it possible to add polymorphic operations to existing classes, without modifying them. They make patterns like Visitor unnecessary.",
