### Compilation Errors

OpenMethod is a library that emulates a language feature. Unfortunately, it
cannot produce diagnostics as good as what a compiler can. Compilation errors
often take the form of template instantiation failures, which can be hard to
decipher. However, most compilation errors can be traced back to a few common
mistakes, which have their typical signature.

The most frequent error a novice user is likely to encounter is a failure to
match an overrider to a method.

include::{example}/match_no_method.cpp[tag=content]

The error here is obvious: we are definiting an overrider for a method that does
not exist. clang 20 gives this error message:
