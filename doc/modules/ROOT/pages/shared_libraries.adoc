This section discusses how OpenMethod interoperates with shared libraries on
Linux, other POSIX-like platforms, and Windows.

### Static Linking

Statically linking to a shared library behaves the same way as linking to a
static library on all platforms. Objects from the program and the shared
libraries can contribute classes, methods and overriders to the default
registry, or any registries.

### Dynamic Linking

By "dynamic linking", we mean a program loading a shared library after it has
started, and accessing its content. A common application of dynamic linking is
to implement plugin architectures.

OpenMethod uses global data to keep track of methods, overriders and classes,
all managed by static constructors and destructors. cpp:initialize[] uses that
information to set up dispatch tables. These variables must be truly global and
unique for the library to operate correctly.

Under this condition, a shared library can dynamically add classes, methods and
overriders to an existing registry. `initialize` must be called to rebuild the
dispatch tables after loading or unloading a shared library.

Dynamic linking on Linux and POSIX-like platforms fulfills the unicity
requirement with little effort from the programmer. On Linux, it is just a
matter of tossing in `-rdynamic`, or adding `ENABLE_EXPORTS ON` to the library's
target properties if using `cmake`.

If a library only uses its own registries, for example, if using open-methods as
an implementation detail, it has its own global data, and there is no need to
call `initialize`.

Let's look at an example. The following header is included by the program and
the shared library:

[source,c++]
----
include::{shared}/animals.hpp[tag=content]
----

The shared library contains an object that adds two overriders, a new class,
`Tiger`, and a factory function:

[source,c++]
----
include::{shared}/extensions.cpp[tag=content]
----

The main program adds a couple of classes then calls `meet` method. At this
point, we only have the catch-call overrider:

[source,c++]
----
include::{shared}/dynamic_main.cpp[tag=before]
----

We load the shared library using Boost.DLL. After calling `initialize`, the new
overriders are installed. The main program can also use `Tiger` objects, even
though it has no knowledge of that class at compile time.

[source,c++]
----
include::{shared}/dynamic_main.cpp[tag=load]
----

Finally, we unload the shared library and call `initialize` again. The
overriders provided by the shared library are removed from the method.

[source,c++]
----
include::{shared}/dynamic_main.cpp[tag=unload]
----

### Windows

If we try the aboveexample on Windows, the result is disappointing:

```
Before loading the shared library.
cow meets wolf -> greet
wolf meets cow -> greet

After loading the shared library.
cow meets wolf -> greet
wolf meets cow -> greet
cow meets tiger -> unknown class struct Tiger
```

What happens here is that the program and the DLL have their own copies of
"global" variables. When the DLL is loaded, its static constructors run, and
they add overriders to _their_ copy of the method (the `method::fn` static
variable for the given name and signature). They are ignored when the main
program calls `initialize`.

Likewise, `BOOST_OPENMETHOD_CLASSES(Tiger, Carnivore);` in the DLL adds `Tiger`
to the DLL's copy of the registry. For the perspective of the program's
registry, the class does not exist.

In theory, this can be fixed by adding `__declspec(dllimport)` and
`__declspec(dllexport)` attributes where needed. However, this is not practical,
because programs and DLLs can both import and export registries and methods. The
underlying objects are instantiated from templates, which complicates the
matter. Research is being done on this subject. However, as of now, dynamic
loading is supported on Windows only if it does not attempt to share a registry
across modules.

### Indirect Vptrs

`initialize` rebuilds the v-tables in the registry. This invalidates all the
`virtual_ptr`{empty}s, and also the v-table pointers stored in objects by
cpp:inplace_vptr_base[], related to that registry. This is seldom an issue, as
most programs that dynamically load shared libraries do so at the very beginning
of their execution.

Otherwise, indirect v-table pointers must be used. This is achieved by using a
registry that contains the cpp:indirect_vptr[] policy.
`<boost/openmethod/default_registry.hpp>` provides an cpp:indirect_registry[]
that has the same policies as `default_registry`, plus `indirect_vptr`. We can
use it to override the default registry, for example using a compiler
command-line switch (`-DBOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY=indirect_registry`).

Here is an example of a program that carries `virtual_ptr`{empty}s across
`initialize` calls:

[source,c++]
----
include::{shared}/indirect_main.cpp[tag=content]
----

This program loads a shared library that is itself compiled with
`-DBOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY=indirect_registry`.
