Open-methods can be as fast as ordinary virtual member functions when
compiled with optimization.

First, let's examine the code generated by clang for an ordinary virtual
function call:

[source,c++]
----
void call_virtual_function(const Node& node, std::ostream& os) {
    node.postfix(os);
}
----

Clang compiles this function to the following assembly on the x64 architecture:

[source,asm]
----
mov	rax, qword ptr [rdi]
mov	rax, qword ptr [rax + 24]
jmp	rax                             # TAILCALL
----

llvm-mca estimates this code has a throughput of 1 cycle per dispatch.

Let's look at a method call now:

[source,c++]
----
void call_via_ref(const Node& node, std::ostream& os) {
    postfix(node, os);
}
----

This compiles to (variable names are shortened for readability):

[source,asm]
----
	mov		rax, rdi
	mov		rcx, qword ptr [rdi]
	mov		rdi, qword ptr [rip + mult]
	imul 	rdi, qword ptr [rcx - 8]
	movzx	ecx, byte ptr [rip + shift]
	shr		rdi, cl
	mov		rdx, rsi
	mov		rcx, qword ptr [rip + vptr_vector_vptrs]
	mov		rdi, qword ptr [rcx + 8*rdi]
	mov		rcx, qword ptr [rip + postfix::fn+88]
	mov		rcx, qword ptr [rdi + 8*rcx]
	mov		rsi, rax
	jmp		rcx                             # TAILCALL
----

This is quite a few instructions more. Upon closer examination, we see that many
are memory reads, independent of one another; they can thus be executed in
parallel. For example, the first three instructions can execute simultaneously.

llvm-mca estimates a throughput of 4 cycles per dispatch. However, the
difference is amortized by the time spent passing the arguments and returning
from the function; plus, of course, executing the body of the function.

Micro- and RDTSC-based benchmarks suggest that dispatching an open-methods with
a single virtual argument _via_ _a_ _reference_ is between 30% and 50% slower
than calling the equivalent virtual function, with an empty body and no other
arguments. In most real programs, the overhead would be unnoticeable.

*However*, `call_via_ref` does two things: it constructs a `virtual_ptr<Node>`
from a `const Node&`; and then it calls the method.

The construction of the `virtual_ptr` is the costly part. It performs a lookup
in a perfect hash table, indexed by pointers to `std::type_info`, to find the
correct vtable. Then it stores a pointer to it in the `virtual_ptr` object,
along with a pointer to the object.footnote:[This is how Go and Rust implement
dynamic dispatch.]

If we already have a `virtual_ptr`:

[source,c++]
----
void call_via_virtual_ptr(virtual_ptr<const Node> node, std::ostream& os) {
    postfix(node, os);
}
----

A method call compiles to:

[source,asm]
----
mov	rax, qword ptr [rip + postfix::fn+88]
mov	rax, qword ptr [rdi + 8*rax]
jmp	rax                             # TAILCALL
----

`virtual_ptr` arguments are passed through the method call, to the overrider,
which can use them to make further method calls.

Code that incorporates open-methods in its design should use
`virtual_ptr`{empty}s in place of plain pointers or references, as much as
possible. Here is the Node example, rewritten to use `virtual_ptr`{empty}s
thoughout:
