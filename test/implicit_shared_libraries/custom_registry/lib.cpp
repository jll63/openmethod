// This library owns and exports the registry state; main.cpp imports it. That
// is the natural direction for implicit linking: the executable already links
// this library, so on Windows the import-library dependency runs the usual way
// (see the "Implicit Linking" section of shared_libraries.adoc).
//
// OWNS_REGISTRY_STATE selects the exported declaration in registry.hpp; it is
// defined by every translation unit of this library (see also lib2.cpp).

// The export is an explicit instantiation *definition*, so a program may
// contain only one: it belongs in a .cpp, never in a header, and this is that
// one place. The matching exported *declaration* in registry.hpp has already
// been seen by this point, in this and every other translation unit of the
// library, which is what keeps the symbol at default visibility.
